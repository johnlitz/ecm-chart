# ecm-chart
Economic Confidence Model chart created by Martin Armstrong. All rights go to him as I simply wanted to see future dates and how accurate I could make it.

This was made with regard to the S&P 500 from May 20, 2004 to April 1, 2024.
To add future dates, I visited twelvedata.com and signed up to use their S&P 500 API. Simply download their .csv and it will give you the most recent dates and numbers.

The dates that are found without a dot are cycles start times that are predicted in the future.

Please feel free to update my code to experiment and/or make it more accurate.
